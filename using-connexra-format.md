Maybe the most important takeaway from the course is the connexra format user story for specifying features for software.  The connexra format uses the following template for telling a user story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit].  The format captures the who, what, and why in a succinct way that can be expressed on a sticky note.  It’s important to distinguish between an “epic” and a single feature.  For example, an epic might be: as a shopper, I want a website that allows me to buy books so I don’t have to go to the bookstore.”  A feature within that epic might be: as a shopper, I want a wishlist so I can record books I want to buy in the future someplace.

Another feature of the format is that beyond being succinct, it pushes managers to be very deliberate about necessary features and helps you prioritize them.

A continuation of the conextra format that can be useful for getting more specific with acceptance criteria for user stories is BDD (Behavior Driven Development), which uses the following template: "Given that..[initial context], when..[event occurs], then..[some outcome(s)]."
