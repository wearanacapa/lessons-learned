Hiring developers is something I anticipate doing regularly in the future. Knowing what questions to ask can save me a lot of time/money/pain as a manager. Specifically:

1. Which (thing) do you use?
2. What do you compare it to?
3. Why did you pick it?

These questions apply to unit testing tools, version control systems and frameworks - all important tools for a developer to do their job well. Learning a little bit more these best practices - the need for version control systems, frameworks that can speed development, etc - will help me spot the disaster engineers.

The long-term the goals is to get good enough at sniffing out the bad engineers that we only hire good ones by default and can focus instead on growing the business!
