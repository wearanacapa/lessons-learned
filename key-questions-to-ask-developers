Hiring developers is something I anticipate doing regularly in the future. Knowing what questions to ask can save me a lot of time/money/pain as a manager.

1. Which (thing) do you use?
2. What do you compare it to?
3. Why did you pick it?

Also knowing a little bit more about best practices like version control systems, frameworks that can speed development, will help spot the disaster engineers.
Long-term the goals is to get good enough at sniffing out the bad engineers that we only hire good ones by default and can focus instead on growing the business!
